# school-management-backend

This is a backend system for managing school operations, connecting teachers, learners, and parents to improve education accessibility.

It is written in Golang and the DB in MySQL.

# If You Want To Try It Out
- Make sure you have Golang installed in your machine
- Make sure you have MySQL installed and configured to work too
- Fork and Clone this repo
- Inside model/ you will find sql scripts, have a look and execute them to have a DB setup similar to mine (feel free to create your own)
- when you run main, this will listen to port 8080
- so your api calls need to talk to port 8080

## For Now I Have Assumed You Have Some Coding Experience And I Trust You Can Figure Out How Run This System
- I will come back with a nice readme, for now I am still fighting with frontend (HELP ME HERE AND THERE)
